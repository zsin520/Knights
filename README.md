# Knights
In a Knights and Knaves puzzle, the following information is given: Each character is either a knight or a knave. A knight will always tell the truth: if knight states a sentence, then that sentence is true. Conversely, a knave will always lie: if a knave states a sentence, then that sentence is false.

The objective of the puzzle is, given a set of sentences spoken by each of the characters, determine, for each character, whether that character is a knight or a knave.

logic.py was provided which defines several classes for different types of logical connectives. A function recursively considers all possible models, and returns True if the knowledge base entails the query, and returns False otherwise. In the context of this project, knowledge bases were defined for puzzles 0-4 in puzzle.py
